unisocks r&d
============

Why unisocks mechanism?

 - Built-in liquidity.
 - Automatic price discovery.
 - Simple to set scarcity.

Unisocks are perfect models for funding public goods using NFT's. This is the beginning - see [cryptofees](https://twitter.com/dmihal/status/1577679080991883264), [potion](https://twitter.com/CryptoEsp/status/1579584243847827456) and of course my baby, [dappnet](https://twitter.com/liamzebedee/status/1578128222536970240)

People [hate royalties](https://blockworks.co/sudoswap-erupts-as-nft-traders-capitalize-on-royalty-free-sales/). IMO they are boomer ideas - like "transfer fees" on ERC20's in the 2018 bull cycle. 

Projects are looking for sustainable income streams - even [launching their own branded OpenSea to capture fees](https://twitter.com/cygaar_dev/status/1579175506510983168).

## Concept.

 * Unisocks mechanism - it's a Uniswap AMM for an NFT.
 * white-label - anyone can launch an NFT using this.
 * trading fees go to the NFT creator.

## Further ideas.

 * Curve mechanism. Instead of fees to creator, fees go 50% to holders, 50% to a DAO, and there is governance which can change this.

## To research.

 - How much ETH liquidity was necessary for the unisocks pool at launch? Was it prohibitive (ie. >1ETH). How could be solve this? ie. virtual liquidity curve.
